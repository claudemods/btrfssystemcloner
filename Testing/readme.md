v1.04.2 18-06-2025 

from further tests trying to get cachyos's handheld edition's system into a btrfs compressed .img

evan with correct uuids in fstab and systemd-boot files it still will not boot

maybe theres files for steam that use uuids i will look and see but for now 

im stuck and cannot find a fix for cachyos handheld edition so im unable to compress the system from around 15gb to say 10gb



02-06-2025 v1.04.2-v1.04.3


im also currently testing ubuntu the code was changed but never tested so please wait

as for fedora i need to recode to install a boot loader more to test........







31-05-2025 v1.04.3

my code is being rewritten to support a new layout for multi distribution support

it wont be hard most of it is already written this ofcourse is rolling release software

things can and will change 

so far from ubuntu and fedora tests snap cannot be installed 

new features coming set size of .img and after .img generation it will ask if you want to resize to have only 10% extra of the .img size
