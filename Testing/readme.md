the updates to cloners for cachyos will soon be released

ive changed it to detect system used size and take 1.7gb off 

it now uses zstd level 22 compression so the final release might take 2.5gb off at the moment im just testing

both uefi grub and uefi systemd-boot files use the same method and will work from tests

once im finished testing i will release the updates of my arch variants (v1.04.2)

im also currently testing ubuntu the code was changed but never test so please wait

as for fedora i need to recode to install a boot loader more to test........







31-05-2025 v1.04.3

my code is being rewritten to support a new layout for multi distribution support

it wont be hard most of it is already written this ofcourse is rolling release software

things can and will change 

so far from ubuntu and fedora tests snap cannot be installed 

new features coming set size of .img and after .img generation it will ask if you want to resize to have only 10% extra of the .img size
