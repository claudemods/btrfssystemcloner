my code is being rewritten to support a new layout for multi distribution support

it wont be hard most of it is already written this ofcourse is rolling release software

things can and will change 

so far from ubuntu and fedora tests snap cannot be installed 

new features coming set size of .img and after .img generation it will ask if you want to resize to have only 10% extra of .img
